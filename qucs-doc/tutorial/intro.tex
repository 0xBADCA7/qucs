\section*{Important note and warning}

You should take into account the fact that this doc is written on the fly, so some mistake are still possible, and the author is not responsible for any damage due to the use of this doc.

\bigskip

This document is intended to e a work book fro RF and microwave designers. Our intention is not to provide an RF courses, but some touchy RF topics. The goal is to insist on some design rules and work flow for RF desings using CAD programs. These work flow will be handle through different chapters on quite different subjects.

\section*{Work book content}

In this workbook, we will pass through some regular tasks. But there is a progression on the explanations, and due to the fact that we have to cover a huge amount of information, some key point will be shown ony once, so it is recommanded to read the chapter in order. 

\bigskip

This work book will include:

\begin{description}
\item[Work flow: ] the regular process of project design is shown,

\item[Understqnding RF data sheets: ] a usual task, that could be hell, could turn a project into a nightmare,

\item[BJT Modeling: ] after having chosen a devvice, we always need to use in the CAD, and usually this device do not exits in the CAD ... how to create it and verify

\item[DC static: ] since all active device has to be biased ...

\item[PA Desgin: ] the active component is found, and a small amplifier is designed without to many constraint

\item[LNA Design: ] a more constraint design using more rules, stability, noise etc ...

\item[oscillator design: ] a procedure that is typicyl from CAD issues, handling non usual procedure,

\item[vco design: ] a normal evolution from a oscillator,

\item[detector: ] a design difficult to handle.

\item[more will come \ldots]

\end{description}
